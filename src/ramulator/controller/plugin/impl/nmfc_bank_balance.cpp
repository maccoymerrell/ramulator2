/*
 * NMFCBankBalance — is the machine actually using every bank?
 *
 * A tile can be at 78% of its channel's peak bandwidth and still be leaving a
 * great deal on the floor if its requests pile onto a few banks: the aggregate
 * looks respectable because the busy banks are saturated, while the idle ones
 * contribute nothing and never appear in a bandwidth figure. Nothing measured so
 * far would have caught that -- row hit rates say what happens once a request
 * reaches a bank, not whether the banks are evenly fed.
 *
 * It matters here more than in a conventional machine. The placement pass silos
 * data at grain granularity, the allocator hands out grains in groups, and the
 * graph structures are grain-aligned and walked with regular strides. Every one
 * of those is a chance for a stride to land on a subset of banks, and the
 * symptom would be indistinguishable from "the workload is just slow".
 *
 * Counts accesses per flat bank and reports the spread: perfectly even is 1.00,
 * and anything much above it means some banks are doing the work of several.
 * Part of the memory model, so both simulators get it from the library.
